Some of the common services that Mermaid Mira provides are listed below, but if you have something else in mind please reach out and we can see what we can do.

* Entertainment for a Party, where Mira swims in a pool and interacts with guests who are not in the water with her.

Please include the following information when booking:

  NOTE: it is your responsibility to book and pay for the pool
* Approximately many guests you plan on inviting
* What packages you're interested in
